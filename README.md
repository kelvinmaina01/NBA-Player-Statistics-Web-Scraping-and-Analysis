# 🏀 NBA Player Statistics Web Scraping and Analysis

## 📌 Introduction
This project demonstrates how to **web scrape NBA player statistics** from  
[Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com) using **Python** and the **pandas** library—specifically the powerful `read_html()` function.

The notebook walks through the complete workflow:
- Dynamically constructing URLs for different NBA seasons  
- Extracting structured data from HTML tables  
- Performing essential data cleaning  
- Conducting a quick **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to gain insights into player performance  

This serves as a practical example of combining **web scraping**, **data wrangling**, and **visual analytics** in a clean and reproducible way.
